This is **Unofficial Ruffle Flash Player** Based on [Ruffle Flash Emulator](https://ruffle.rs).

I'm not the official developer of Ruffle. For issues and documentation related to the emulator, please refer to the official Ruffle repository documentation below.

**Official Ruffle Desktop Player** is here!: https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle

(*This is just an emulator and does not contain any games.)

</div>

## ‚≠ê Features
 - ‚úÖ It is a desktop player that not only replaces Adobe Flash Player, but also makes it easy to use Ruffle.
 - ‚úÖ Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux supported!
 - ‚úÖ Multi-language and theme support
 - ‚úÖ Support for running split SWF files
 - ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop or one-click execution of SWF files from local PC
 - ‚úÖ Continue playing from the list of recently opened files.
 - ‚úÖ Customize various emulator settings.

## üì¢ Compatibility
**Since the emulator is under development, some content may not run smoothly, and Flash created with ActionScript 3 as of March 2021 is not supported.**

See https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/1368.

This app plots the emulator (built for self-hosted use) in a webview, so there may be a performance difference compared to the official Ruffle Desktop Application.

There is no built-in automatic update in the app. It is recommended to download the updated emulator version by referring to the GitHub Release page on a monthly basis.
