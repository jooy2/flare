# ðŸŽ® OpenRuffle Flash Player
This is **"Unofficial" Ruffle Flash Player** Based on [Ruffle Flash Emulator](https://ruffle.rs). It is Electron Desktop App compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux OS.

I'm not the official developer of Ruffle. For issues and documentation related to the emulator, please refer to the official Ruffle repository documentation below.
 - **Official Ruffle Desktop Player** is here!: https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle

**Since the emulator is under development, some content may not run smoothly, and Flash created with ActionScript 3 as of March 2021 is not supported.**

This app plots the emulator (built for selfhosted use) in a webview, so there may be a performance difference compared to the official Ruffle Desktop Application.

There is no built-in automatic update in the app. It is recommended to download the updated emulator version by referring to the GitHub Release page on a monthly basis.
